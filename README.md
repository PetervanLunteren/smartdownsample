# smartdownsample

**Efficient downsampling for image classification datasets**

SmartDownsample selects the most diverse images from large collections, ideal for reducing dataset size while preserving visual variability.

## Installation

```bash
pip install smartdownsample
```

## Usage

```python
from smartdownsample import select_distinct

# Example list of image paths
my_image_list = [
    "path/to/img1.jpg",
    "path/to/img2.jpg",
    "path/to/img3.jpg",
    "path/to/img4.jpg"
]

# Simple selection - get 100 most diverse images
selected = select_distinct(
    image_paths=my_image_list,
    target_count=100
)

# With visual verification to see excluded images in context
selected = select_distinct(
    image_paths=my_image_list,
    target_count=100,
    show_verification=True
)

print(f"Selected {len(selected)} images")

```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `image_paths` | Required | List of image file paths (str or Path objects) |
| `target_count` | Required | Exact number of images to select |
| `window_size` | `100` | Rolling window size (larger = better quality, slower) |
| `random_seed` | `42` | Random seed for reproducible results |
| `show_progress` | `True` | Whether to display progress bars |
| `show_verification` | `False` | Show visual verification of excluded images with context |

## Step by step

1. Images are processed in folder-major order so files from the same folder stay together. Within each folder, paths are naturally sorted (e.g., `img1.jpg`, `img2.jpg`, `img10.jpg`) to keep related images grouped during processing.

2. Images are compared using a rolling window. This runs in O(n) time and scales to large lists images by comparing each candidate only to a sliding window of recent selections. The method computes perceptual hashes and applies greedy selection to maximize diversity while maintaining efficiency.

## Visual Verification

Set `show_verification=True` to see a visual plot showing 10 randomly selected excluded images in their context (3 images before + excluded image + 6 images after). Green borders indicate selected images, red borders show excluded images, and blue borders mark context images. This helps verify the algorithm is working correctly by showing why certain images were excluded.
