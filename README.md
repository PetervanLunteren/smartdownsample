# SmartDownsample 🎯

**Intelligent image downsampling for camera traps and large datasets**

SmartDownsample automatically selects the most diverse and distinct images from large collections, perfect for camera trap data, machine learning datasets, and any scenario where you need to reduce dataset size while maintaining maximum visual diversity.

## ✨ Features

- **🚀 Scales to 100k+ images** - Rolling window algorithm handles massive datasets
- **🎯 Exact count guarantee** - Always returns precisely the number you request
- **🧠 Smart diversity selection** - Uses perceptual hashing to find truly distinct images
- **📸 Camera trap optimized** - Automatically removes duplicate poses and similar captures
- **⚡ Fast processing** - Minutes instead of hours for large datasets
- **🔄 Reproducible results** - Deterministic with random seed control

## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install smartdownsample
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

```python
from smartdownsample import select_distinct
from pathlib import Path

# Get your image paths
image_paths = list(Path("my_camera_trap_data").rglob("*.jpg"))

# Select 1000 most diverse images from any size dataset
selected_images = select_distinct(image_paths, target_count=1000)

print(f"Selected {len(selected_images)} diverse images from {len(image_paths)} total")
```

## 📚 Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
from smartdownsample import select_distinct

# Simple selection - get 100 most diverse images
selected = select_distinct(
    image_paths=my_image_list,
    target_count=100
)
```

### Large Datasets (100k+ images)

```python
# For massive datasets, use rolling window (default method)
selected = select_distinct(
    image_paths=large_dataset_paths,
    target_count=5000,
    method="rolling_window",
    window_size=100  # Adjust for speed vs quality tradeoff
)
```

### Small Datasets (Optimal Quality)

```python
# For smaller datasets, use exact algorithm for optimal results
selected = select_distinct(
    image_paths=small_dataset_paths,
    target_count=50,
    method="exact"  # Best quality but slower for large datasets
)
```

### Camera Trap Workflow

```python
import os
from pathlib import Path
from smartdownsample import select_distinct

# Process camera trap data by species
species_folder = Path("camera_data/grey_squirrel")
all_images = list(species_folder.glob("*.jpg"))

print(f"Found {len(all_images)} grey squirrel images")

# Select most diverse 500 images for training
training_images = select_distinct(
    image_paths=all_images,
    target_count=500,
    random_seed=42  # For reproducible results
)

# Copy selected images to training folder
training_folder = Path("training_data/grey_squirrel")
training_folder.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)

for img_path in training_images:
    img_name = Path(img_path).name
    shutil.copy2(img_path, training_folder / img_name)

print(f"Selected {len(training_images)} diverse images for training")
```

## ⚙️ Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `image_paths` | Required | List of image file paths (str or Path objects) |
| `target_count` | Required | Exact number of images to select |
| `method` | `"rolling_window"` | Algorithm: `"rolling_window"` (fast) or `"exact"` (optimal) |
| `window_size` | `100` | Rolling window size (larger = better quality, slower) |
| `similarity_threshold` | `0.85` | Similarity threshold for exact method (0-1) |
| `random_seed` | `42` | Random seed for reproducible results |
| `show_progress` | `True` | Whether to display progress bars |

## 🏎️ Performance

| Dataset Size | Method | Processing Time | Memory Usage |
|--------------|--------|----------------|--------------|
| 1,000 images | exact | ~30 seconds | Low |
| 1,000 images | rolling_window | ~3 seconds | Low |
| 10,000 images | rolling_window | ~30 seconds | Low |
| 100,000 images | rolling_window | ~5 minutes | Low |

## 🧮 Algorithm Details

### Rolling Window Method (Default)
- **Best for**: Large datasets (1k+ images)
- **Time complexity**: O(n × window_size) ≈ O(n)
- **How it works**: Compares each candidate only to recently selected images
- **Advantage**: Scales to massive datasets while maintaining diversity

### Exact Method
- **Best for**: Small datasets (<1k images) where optimal quality is needed
- **Time complexity**: O(n²)
- **How it works**: Compares each candidate to all previously selected images
- **Advantage**: Mathematically optimal diversity selection

Both methods:
1. Calculate perceptual hashes (256-bit fingerprints) for all images
2. Use greedy selection to maximize minimum distance between selected images
3. Guarantee exact target count while maximizing visual diversity

## 🎯 Use Cases

- **Camera trap research**: Remove duplicate animal poses, keep temporal diversity
- **Machine learning datasets**: Reduce training data while maintaining class diversity  
- **Photography collections**: Select best shots from burst sequences
- **Data annotation**: Choose most informative images for labeling
- **Storage optimization**: Keep only the most distinct images
